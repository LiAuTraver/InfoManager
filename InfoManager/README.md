# OVERVIEW

This Student Information Manager is a simple yet effective application designed to manage and store student data. It is
built using WinUI 3 and follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) design pattern, which separates the application's user
interface (UI), data, and control logic into three separate elements.
The application consists of several key components:

1. Models: The Student class is the primary data model in this application. It represents the data related to a student,
   such as their ID and grades.
2. Services: The StudentService class is responsible for managing the student data. It provides methods for finding,
   adding, and checking if a student's information has changed. The AppNotificationService and LocalSettingsService
   classes handle app notifications and local settings, respectively.
3. ViewModels: The DataViewModel class is the ViewModel for the data view. It interacts with the StudentService to
   manage the student data and updates the view accordingly.
4. Views: The views are not shown in the provided context, but they would typically be XAML files that define the UI of
   the application.
   The application uses the CommunityToolkit.Mvvm package for its MVVM infrastructure. This includes base classes for
   the ViewModel (ObservableRecipient) and commands (ICommand), which help to separate the UI from the business logic.
   The StudentService class uses a list of Student objects (_students) to store the student data. It provides methods to
   manipulate this data, such as FindStudent, AddStudent, and IsStudentInfoChanged.
   The DataViewModel class uses the StudentService to interact with the student data. It provides a method IsDataChanged
   to check if a student's information has changed and update the UI accordingly.
   Overall, this Student Information Manager is a well-structured application that follows best practices for MVVM
   design in WinUI 3 applications. It provides a solid foundation for managing student data and can be easily extended
   with additional features and functionality.

Sure, I'd be happy to provide some feedback on your code structure and design principles. Here are some points to
consider:

1. Separation of Concerns: It's important to keep your UI logic separate from your data logic. In your OpenInfoFile
   method in MainPage.xaml.cs, you're doing file operations directly in the UI layer. It would be better to move this
   logic to a service or helper class.
2. ViewModel Responsibilities: Your ViewModel should be responsible for handling the application's business logic and
   should not contain any UI code. In your AddDataDialog method in DataPage.xaml.cs, you're creating and managing a
   dialog directly in the ViewModel. This should be done in the View.
3. Error Handling: It's important to handle errors gracefully in your application. In your AddDataDialog method, you're
   showing a dialog with an error message when something goes wrong, but it's not clear what the user should do next.
   Consider providing more helpful error messages and possible solutions.
4. Code Duplication: Avoid duplicating code. In your AddDataDialog method, you're checking if the text of each TextBox
   is not null and showing an error dialog if it is. This code is repeated for each TextBox. Consider creating a helper
   method to perform this check.
5. Magic Strings: Avoid using magic strings in your code. In your LocalSettingsService.cs, you're using string literals
   for the default application data folder and local settings file. Consider moving these to a constants class or
   configuration file.
6. Code Comments: Use comments to explain why you're doing something, not what you're doing. In your IsDataChanged
   method in DataViewModel.cs, you're using comments to explain what the code is doing. This should be clear from the
   code itself. If it's not, consider refactoring your code to make it more readable.
7. Null Checking: Be careful with null checking. In your IsDataChanged method, you're using the is not pattern to check
   if a value is not null. This can be confusing and is not commonly used. Consider using the != null pattern instead.
8. Method Naming: Use clear and descriptive names for your methods. The name of your IsDataChanged method suggests that
   it returns a boolean, but it actually returns a nullable boolean. Consider renaming this method to better reflect
   what it does.
9. Initialization: In your MainPage.xaml.cs and LaunchPage.xaml.cs, you're initializing the ViewModel in the
   constructor. This could lead to issues if the ViewModel has any dependencies that are not yet available. Consider
   using a factory or dependency injection to create your ViewModels.
10. Data Binding: Consider using data binding to connect your UI with your data. This can simplify your code and make it
    easier to maintain. In your AddDataDialog method, you're manually getting the text from each TextBox. This could be
    done automatically with data binding.
